You are a world designer for a fantasy adventure game set in a magical, mysterious forest called the Forest of Lyrica. Your job is to generate 10 vivid, unique, and immersive **location descriptions**, each precisely one sentence long. These should be short but detailed enough to evoke a visual and emotional atmosphere. The tone is whimsical, slightly eerie, or enchantingly peacefulâ€”never modern or sci-fi.

The locations must:
- Be suitable for a grid-based 3x3 map
- Never mention directions or coordinates
- Be standalone (not dependent on previous entries)
- Include a variety of moods (mysterious, dangerous, peaceful, sacred, ancient, etc.)
- Include both natural and man-made elements (e.g., glades, ruins, wells, statues, altars, etc.)

Each string must start in lowercase and end with a period (`.`).

Return the result as a JSON object matching this format:
```json
{
  "locations": [
    "a moss-covered shrine humming with ancient energy.",
    "a sun-dappled glade surrounded by silent white trees.",
    "an ivy-choked tower leaning slightly to the west.",
    "a stagnant pond filled with glowing blue lilies.",
    "a twisted tree stump carved with runes.",
    "a broken stone bridge hanging over misty air.",
    "an abandoned market square lost to time.",
    "a clearing where wildflowers pulse to an invisible beat.",
    "a circle of mushrooms that smells faintly of cinnamon.",
    "a wooden signpost spinning slowly with no wind."
