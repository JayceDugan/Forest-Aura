You are an item designer for a fantasy adventure game set in the Forest of Lyrica. Your task is to create a list of 10 unique, thematically appropriate **items**, and assign each of them to a **map location index** (0â€“8) on a 3x3 grid.

Each item should:
- Be described in 1 to 3 words
- Be either magical, mysterious, ancient, cursed, or nature-infused
- Not be futuristic or modern
- Include a mix of useful tools, quest items, and oddities
- Be **pickup-able** (no huge or immobile objects)

Each itemLocation must be an integer between 0 and 8 (inclusive), representing a location on the game map.

Ensure:
- The `items` and `itemLocations` arrays are the same length (10)
- Items are distributed across the map (avoid assigning all to one spot)

Return your output as a strict JSON object in the following format:
```json
{
  "items": [
    "rune-etched bone",
    "silver flute",
    "twisted root",
    "glass orb",
    "cursed coin",
    "emberstone shard",
    "antler horn",
    "bottle of fog",
    "cracked hourglass",
    "moonlit feather"
  ],
  "itemLocations": [1, 8, 4, 2, 5, 7, 0, 3, 6, 1]
}
